## Summary

Security Test Management is the process of planning, monitoring, and supervise the security testing activities to ensure the security of a product during its lifecycle. 

It involves several key activities:

- Requirement Analysis: Understanding the security requirements and setting clear testing objectives.
  - Ref: DSOVS-REQ-001, DSOVS-REQ-002, DSOVS-REQ-003
- Test Planning: Defining the overall security testing strategy,
  - Defining scope
  - Managment of resources.
  - Tooling and automation support 
- Test Design and Development: Creating detailed test cases and scripts.
  - Ref: DSOVS-TEST-005
- Test Execution: Running the test cases and documenting any defects.
  - Ref: DSOVS-TEST-005, DSOVS-REQ-004, DSOVS-REL-007
- Test Closure: Summarizing testing activities and identifying areas for improvement.
  - Ensuring that security testing is included in retrospectives and improved over time, both focusing on efficiency and quality.

Security Test Management is crucial for delivering secure software. 
It helps in identifying security defects early, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and providing visibility and control over the security testing process. Modern security test tools often include features for automation, tracking, and reporting, which streamline the entire process.

## Level 0 - Security Test Management is perfomed informally

Practices are “ad hoc” where the intent of the control is not met due to a lack consistency and formality. A reasonable person would conclude the control is not consistently performed in a structured manner.
This level of maturity is defined as “ad hoc practices,” where the control is being performed, but lacks completeness & consistency.
- Base practices of the process area are generally performed.
- The performance of these base practices may not be rigorously planned and tracked.
- Performance depends on individual knowledge and effort.
- There are identifiable improvments for the process.

## Level 1 - Security Test Management is planned and tracked

Practices are “requirements-driven” where the intent of control is met in some circumstances, but not standardized across the entire team.
This level of maturity is defined as “requirements-driven practices,” where the expectations for controls are known (e.g., statutory, regulatory or contractual compliance obligations) and practices are tailored to meet those specific requirements.
- Performance of the base practices in the process area is planned and tracked.
- Performance according to specified procedures is partly verified.
- There is lack of automation and tooling, that could improve quality, consistancy and/or efficiency.

## Level 2 - Security Test Management is well-defined

Practices are standardized where the control is well-defined and standardized across the entire team.
- Base practices are performed according to a well-defined process using approved, tailored versions of standard, documented processes.
- Process is planned and managed using an organization-wide, standardized process.

## Level 3 - Security Test Management is quantitatively controlled and continuously improving

Practices are “metrics-driven” where the control builds on Level 2 maturity, but has detailed metrics to enable governance oversight.
This level of maturity is defined as “metrics-driven practices,” where in addition to being well-defined and standardized practices, there are detailed metrics to enable governance oversight.
- Detailed measures of performance are collected and analyzed. This leads to a quantitative understanding of process capability and an improved ability to predict performance.
- Performance is objectively managed, and the quality of work products is quantitatively known.
- Quantitative performance goals (targets) for process effectiveness and efficiency are established, based on the business goals of the organization.
- Continuous process improvement against these goals is enabled by quantitative feedback from performing the defined processes and from piloting innovative ideas and technologies.
